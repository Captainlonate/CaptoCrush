CaptoCrush
==========

Match-three tile game like puzzle pirates' Bilging or bejewled

CaptoCrush is basically Bejeweled or Puzzle Pirates' bilging.
You just swap tiles and try to match at least 3 in a row ( or column ).
It took about a day including the artwork which I did in Inkscape.

INTERNET EXPLORER DOES NOT WORK. FOR BEST RESULTS, WINDOWS USERS USE FIREFOX,
MAC USERS USE SAFARI.
